### **Work Experience**

## LUMACOOL

* Identified market pain points in mainstream delivery platforms, including high commission rates (up to 50%) and lack of data transparency, leading the planning, development, and implementation of an independent digital ordering and delivery platform, Lumacool Delivery, for the self-created brand LUMACOOL, aimed at reducing operational costs for merchants, gaining control of customer data, and enabling autonomous marketing.
* Independently managed the entire lifecycle of the Lumacool Delivery platform, from market analysis, business model design, product planning (including membership, orders, coupons, referral rewards, and other core modules) to technical architecture (Python FastAPI, Next.js, GCP, Firestore) and full-stack development with MVP version cloud deployment ([https://www.lumacool.com/](https://www.lumacool.com/)).
* Formulated and executed initial O2O operational strategies (such as online point card conversion, referral rewards), successfully launched the platform MVP, providing merchants with autonomous operational options, expected to significantly reduce platform commissions, and achieve customer data autonomy and precision marketing.
* Gained comprehensive experience in entrepreneurship and product development from zero to one, validating the ability to apply technical solutions in complex business environments, and acquiring valuable market insights and project management experience (the physical store operation ended due to external factors, but the core digital platform completed its phase development).
