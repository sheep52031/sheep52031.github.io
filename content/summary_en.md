With approximately three years of software development and cloud technology experience, I am dedicated to transforming technical insights into concrete business solutions. I approach challenges from the perspective of market needs, employing systematic project leadership skills and strategic thinking about AI technology implementation for businesses. My focus is on driving projects from concept to successful deployment, with an emphasis on using data analytics to support business decisions and growth.

Recently, I independently led the development of Lumacool Delivery [https://www.lumacool.com](https://www.lumacool.com), a restaurant self-service delivery platform designed to address the high commission rates of mainstream platforms and empower merchants with greater profit margins and marketing autonomy. This project not only demonstrated my comprehensive abilities in market analysis, product design, full-stack development (Python FastAPI, Next.js, GCP), and business model exploration, but also showcased my passion for quickly learning and applying new technologies to real business scenarios. My background also includes experience as a Cloud Engineer at Acer and leading a team in developing an image recognition project during AI application training.

I focus on the commercial application of technology, aiming to transform technical investments into tangible business results and efficiency improvements. Currently, I aspire to delve deeper into business analysis, market strategy, or product planning, utilizing my technical background, the "Builder Mindset" cultivated through entrepreneurial practice, and my attitude of continuous learning to help companies identify growth opportunities, optimize operational efficiency, and collaboratively create valuable products or services.
