With approximately three years of hands-on experience in software development and cloud technologies, I am a cross-disciplinary professional dedicated to transforming technical insights into tangible business solutions. My career has been defined by continuous learning and a to solving real-world business challenges. from an academic background in Electrical Engineering, I have since focused on software development, cloud architecture, and AI applications, always prioritizing the practical application and commercial value of technology.



From Technical Execution to Business Acumen: An Awakening

During nearly six months of intensive AI application development training at TibaMe, I systematically acquired a skillset spanning data processing, machine learning models (such as TensorFlow and YOLOv7), full-stack development (Flask, LineBot), and cloud deployment (Docker, GCP). More critically, I gained invaluable experience applying these skills to a real-world project and collaborating effectively. As a project lead, I spearheaded a 6-member team to successfully build and deploy the "Houtong Cat Village Map & LINE Bot Service" from . This hands-on project profoundly shaped my understanding that technology is not merely code but a powerful tool to realize creative ideas, solve problems, and connect with people—and that teamwork is crucial for bringing complex visions to life. The project earned the "Top 1 Potential Award" at the TibaMe Academy, solidifying my resolve to technology for greater impact.



Entrepreneurial : Building LUMACOOL Delivery from Zero to One

 by a desire to the business world, I founded the LUMACOOL beverage brand in Cebu, Philippines, and independently led the development of the Lumacool Delivery platform (https://www.lumacool.com/). I had keenly observed that mainstream delivery platforms charged high commission rates (up to 50%) that severely impacted local F&B merchants' profitability, while also limiting their control over customer data and marketing .

Lumacool Delivery was conceived to address these pain points. I was responsible for the entire lifecycle, from market analysis, business model design, and product feature planning (including core modules like member management, dynamic menus, shopping cart, order processing, coupons, and referral programs) to technology stack selection (Python FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend) and GCP cloud architecture design and deployment. This was not only a test of my technical capabilities but also a testament to my "Builder Mindset"—identifying a problem, conceptualizing a solution, and personally bringing it to fruition. Although the physical store operations ceased due to factors, the phased completion of the Lumacool Delivery digital platform provided me with invaluable market insights, full-cycle product development management experience, and practical in applying technology to solve complex business challenges. I came to deeply understand that a successful product requires not only robust technology but also a of business logic and a understanding of market needs.



Corporate Exposure and Broadened Cloud 

During my tenure as a Cloud Engineer at Acer Inc., I participated in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) adoption and architecture optimization projects for enterprise clients. I assisted clients with cloud cost analysis and billing optimization, and engaged in discussions on optimizing GCP service configurations (e.g., compute, storage, networking, and database services) to meet a variety of application demands for stability and cost-effectiveness. This role aimed to help clients maximize the ROI of their cloud resources. This experience exposed me to the design and implementation of enterprise-grade cloud solutions and enhanced my ability to communicate and collaborate with client IT teams and OEM technical support in complex technological environments.



Looking Ahead: Technology for Business, by Data

Having navigated through in-depth technical work, entrepreneurial , and corporate services, I have a clearer vision of my strong interest in business analysis, market strategy, and product planning. I am eager to apply my technical background, data analysis potential, project management skills, and the business acumen and problem-solving resolve honed through my entrepreneurial journey to a broader commercial stage.



I am focused on the commercial application of technology, aiming to translate technology investments into visible business outcomes and efficiency gains. I aspire to join an innovative, cross-functionally collaborative team that encourages strategic thinking. In roles such as Business Analyst, Product Strategist, or other positions where I can my hybrid "tech + business" strengths, I aim to help the organization discover new growth opportunities, optimize operational efficiency, and collectively build more products and services, achieving both personal and corporate growth.
