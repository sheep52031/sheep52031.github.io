12:Tc15,I hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Fu Jen Catholic University (2016) and have since dedicated my career to mastering software development, cloud solutions, and project leadership. My journey has been defined by continuous learning and the practical application of cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world business challenges.

**Technical Expertise & Project Leadership**

My primary technical proficiency lies in Python, which I have applied to develop robust backend systems using frameworks such as FastAPI. I have built several projects, including a delivery platform that leverages React for its frontend and utilizes Firebase Firestore and Google Cloud Run for scalable, cost-effective deployment. Although this project is still under development—with ongoing work to integrate advanced AI functionalities—it has allowed me to refine my skills in API integration, containerization with Docker, and serverless architecture design.

I further enhanced my technical toolkit by participating in an intensive AI application development program. During this time, I led a team project to build a cat recognition system using TensorFlow and YOLOv7. This initiative, which integrated our trained model with a LINE messaging bot, not only solidified my understanding of machine learning workflows but also demonstrated my ability to manage cross-functional teams and ensure the seamless integration of complex systems.

**Corporate & Entrepreneurial Experience**

In a subsequent role as a Cloud Engineer at Acer Inc., I contributed to designing and implementing cloud solutions on the Google Cloud Platform. I assisted enterprise clients with cloud migration strategies and collaborated with diverse teams to deliver multi-cloud architectures that balanced performance with cost efficiency. This experience deepened my understanding of cloud infrastructure and enhanced my ability to communicate technical solutions across departments.

My entrepreneurial venture in the Philippines further honed my skills in project management and data-driven decision making. I founded a beverage brand where I not only developed the product and marketing strategy but also initiated the development of an in-house food delivery platform. By leveraging modern development tools and AI agent technologies, I aimed to create a scalable solution that minimizes reliance on costly third-party delivery services. Recognizing the need to focus on my core competencies, I have since transitioned day-to-day operational control of this venture to a trusted local partner, allowing me to fully commit to advancing my technical and management skills in my next professional role.

**Looking Ahead**

I am eager to bring my blend of technical expertise, project leadership, and data-driven strategy to an innovative organization—whether within technology, venture capital, or strategic project management. I am confident that my ability to integrate software solutions with business insights will drive growth and foster innovation in any dynamic, forward-thinking environment.
