12:T70e,With approximately three years of software development and cloud technology experience, I am dedicated to transforming technical insights into concrete business solutions. I approach challenges from the perspective of market needs, employing systematic project leadership skills and strategic thinking about AI technology implementation for businesses. My focus is on driving projects from concept to successful deployment, with an emphasis on using data analytics to support business decisions and growth.

Recently, I independently led the development of Lumacool Delivery [https://www.lumacool.com](https://www.lumacool.com), a restaurant self-service delivery platform designed to address the high commission rates of mainstream platforms and empower merchants with greater profit margins and marketing autonomy. This project not only demonstrated my comprehensive abilities in market analysis, product design, full-stack development (Python FastAPI, Next.js, GCP), and business model exploration, but also showcased my passion for quickly learning and applying new technologies to real business scenarios. My background also includes experience as a Cloud Engineer at Acer and leading a team in developing an image recognition project during AI application training.

I focus on the commercial application of technology, aiming to transform technical investments into tangible business results and efficiency improvements. Currently, I aspire to delve deeper into business analysis, market strategy, or product planning, utilizing my technical background, the "Builder Mindset" cultivated through entrepreneurial practice, and my attitude of continuous learning to help companies identify growth opportunities, optimize operational efficiency, and collaboratively create valuable products or services.14:T60e,* Identified market pain points in mainstream delivery platforms, including high commission rates (up to 50%) and lack of data transparency, leading the planning, development, and implementation of an independent digital ordering and delivery platform, Lumacool Delivery, for the self-created brand LUMACOOL, aimed at reducing operational costs for merchants, gaining control of customer data, and enabling autonomous marketing.
* Independently managed the entire lifecycle of the Lumacool Delivery platform, from market analysis, business model design, product planning (including membership, orders, coupons, referral rewards, and other core modules) to technical architecture (Python FastAPI, Next.js, GCP, Firestore) and full-stack development with MVP version cloud deployment ([https://www.lumacool.com/](https://www.lumacool.com/)).
* Formulated and executed initial O2O operational strategies (such as online point card conversion, referral rewards), successfully launched the platform MVP, providing merchants with autonomous operational options, expected to significantly reduce platform commissions, and achieve customer data autonomy and precision marketing.
* Gained comprehensive experience in entrepreneurship and product development from zero to one, validating the ability to apply technical solutions in complex business environments, and acquiring valuable market insights and project management experience (the physical store operation ended due to external factors, but the core digital platform completed its phase development).15:T578,* Participated in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) implementation and architecture optimization projects for enterprise clients, assisting with cloud cost analysis and billing planning. Engaged in discussions on optimizing GCP cloud services (such as computing, storage, networking, and database services) configuration and architecture adjustment recommendations based on clients' different application scenarios, service stability, and cost-effectiveness requirements, aiming to help clients maximize the cost-effectiveness of cloud resources.
* Served as a technical support role, collaborating with client IT teams and Google's original technical support (including overseas engineers) to help resolve technical challenges encountered by clients in using GCP services, and learning enterprise-level cloud solution design and implementation in the process.
* Responsible for Google Workspace solution customer technical consultation and implementation support, providing requirement analysis, product demonstrations, and operational training for clients across multiple industries, helping enterprises improve cloud collaboration efficiency.
* In a rapidly developing startup business unit, besides core technical responsibilities, also supported marketing activities (such as serving as an online technical forum lecturer), demonstrating rapid learning and cross-functional collaboration capabilities.16:T621,* **UberEats Commercial Photography Project:** Led and successfully delivered UberEats Taiwan's contracted photography service, providing professional food photography, style communication, and shooting execution for over 1,000 food and beverage merchants, helping their digital transformation, significantly enhancing online platform exposure and customer attraction.
* **AI Image Data Collaboration (Meero):** Collaborated with French AI imaging company Meero, providing a large volume of high-quality photography materials for their AI food image recognition and automatic color adjustment model training data accumulation and algorithm optimization.
* **Integrated Marketing and Project Management (Key Client Achievements):**
* **Transportation Service Client Transformation Project:** Served as a marketing planning consultant, achieving a 150% business growth in domestic chartered tour services through LINE official account operation, social media marketing, and digital advertising placement; the long-term care transportation service image video produced under the planning was reported by TVBS News, bringing a 3-fold growth in service inquiry volume.
* **RoboFest Robot Competition (Taoyuan City Youth Bureau Subsidized Project):** Through association cooperation, successfully proposed and undertook the multi-session event recording and marketing promotional video production case for the RoboFest large-scale robot competition subsidized by the Taoyuan City Youth Bureau, demonstrating project proposal and landmark event project execution capabilities.18:T44e,
